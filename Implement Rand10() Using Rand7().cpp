/*
Implement Rand10() Using Rand7()
Given a function rand7 which generates a uniform random integer in the range 1 to 7, write a function rand10 which generates a uniform random integer in the range 1 to 10.

Do NOT use system's Math.random().

 

Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: [7]
Example 2:

Input: 2
Output: [8,4]
Example 3:

Input: 3
Output: [8,1,10]
 

Note:

rand7 is predefined.
Each testcase has one argument: n, the number of times that rand10 is called.
 

Follow up:

What is the expected value for the number of calls to rand7() function?
Could you minimize the number of calls to rand7()?
*/

// The rand7() API is already defined for you.
// int rand7();
// @return a random integer in the range 1 to 7

class Solution {
public:
    int rand10() {
        int v1 = rand7(), v2 = rand7();
        while(v1 > 5) v1 = rand7();
        while(v2 == 7) v2 = rand7();
        return (v2 <= 3) ? v1 : v1 + 5;
    }
};
